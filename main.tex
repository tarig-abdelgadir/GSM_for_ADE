\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Quivers}
A quiver $Q$ is specified by two finite sets $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ together with two maps $h, t \colon Q_1 \rightarrow Q_0$. We call the elements of these sets vertices and arrows, respectively.  The maps $h$ and $t$ indicate the vertices at the head and tail of each arrow.
A nontrivial path in $Q$ is a sequence of arrows $p = a_1 \dotsb a_m$ with $h(a_{k}) = t(a_{k+1})$ for $1 \leq k < m$.  We set $t(p) = t(a_{1})$ and $h(p)= h(a_m)$, the length of $p$ is $m$.  
For each $i \in Q_0$ we have a trivial path $\bfe_i$ where $t(\bfe_i) = h(\bfe_i) = i$.  
The path algebra $\bfk Q$ is the $\bfk$-algebra whose underlying $\bfk$-vector space has a basis consisting of paths in $Q$; the product of two basis elements equals the basis element defined by concatenation of the paths if possible or zero otherwise.

A representation $\bfx = (V_i, x_a)$ of $Q$ consists of a vector space $V_i$ for each $i \in Q_0$ and a linear map $x_a \colon V_{t(a)} \rightarrow V_{h(a)}$ for each $a \in Q_1$. 
The dimension vector of $\bfx$ is the integer vector $(\dim V_{i})_{i\in Q_0}$.  
A map between representations $\bfx = (V_i, x_a)$ and $\bfx' = (V_i', x_a')$ is a family $\xi_{i} \colon V_i^{\,} \rightarrow V_i'$ for $i \in Q_0$ of linear maps that are compatible with the structure maps, that is $x_a' \circ\xi_{t(a)} = \xi_{h(a)} \circ x_a$ for all $a \in Q_1$.  
With composition defined componentwise, we obtain the abelian category of representations of $Q$ denoted rep$_\bfk(Q)$. 
This category is equivalent to the category $\bfk Q$-mod of finitely generated left modules over the path algebra.
A relation $r$ on $Q$ is a finite linear combination of paths that share the same head and tail.
A quiver with relations is $Q$ along with a finite set of relations $R$.
A representation of a $(Q,R)$ is a representation of $Q$ for which $x_r=0$ for all $r\in R$.
Representations of $(Q,R)$ correspond to left modules of $\bfk Q/ \langle R \rangle$.

Given a dimension vector $\bfv$, a $\theta \in \bZ^{Q_0}$ for which $\bfv \cdot \theta=0$ defines a stability notion for representations of $Q$ with dimension vector $\bfd$.
A representation $\bfx$ is $\theta$-semistable if, for every proper, nonzero subrepresentation $\bfx' \subset \bfx$, we have $\sum_{i \in Q_0} \theta_i \cdot \dim(V_i') \geq 0$.  
The notion of $\theta$-stability is obtained by replacing $\geq$ with $>$. 
For a given dimension vector $\bfd \in \bZ_{Q_0}$, a family of $\theta$-semistable quiver representations over a connected scheme $S$ is a collection of rank $\alpha_i$ locally free sheaves $\cV_i$ together with morphisms $\cV_{t(a)} \rightarrow \cV_{h(a)}$ for every $a\in Q_1$. 
When every $\theta$-semistable representation is $\theta$-stable and the dimension vector is primitive this moduli problem is representable by a scheme $\cM_\theta(Q, \bfd)$, see Proposition 5.3 in \cite{King}.
The space $\cM_\theta(Q, \bfd)$ may be expressed as a quotient stack as follows: pick vector spaces $V_i$ of dimension $d_i$ then $$\cM_\theta(Q,\bfd) = \bigoplus_{a \in Q_1} \Hom(V_{t(a)}, V_{h(a)})$$
We may define analogous notions for quivers with relations, we will denote the corresponding moduli spaces by $\cM_\theta(Q,R,\bfv)$.

\subsection{McKay correspondence}
Not only is this an abridged version of a rich story but we also spin it here to motivate what follows.
Fix a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset \SL(2,\bC)$ and let $\rho_0, \ldots, \rho_N$ be its
irreducible representations. 
We take $V=\bC^2$ to be the defining representation of $\Gamma$.
Set $I=\{0,\ldots,N\}$.
The monoidal category $\Rep(\Gamma)$ is semi-simple therefore $$\rho_i \otimes V \simeq \bigoplus_{j \in I} c_{ij} \, \rho_j$$
with $c_{ij} =\dim \Hom_{\bC G}(\rho_i \otimes V, \rho_j)$.
The numbers $c_{ij}$ allow us to define a quiver whose vertices parametrised by $I$ with $c_{ij}$ arrows from $i$ to $j$; this is the McKay quiver.
We identify an arrow $i \rightarrow j$ with a certain morphism of representations $P_i^j \colon \rho_i \otimes V \rightarrow \rho_j$.
This gives a natural isomorphism between $\Hom_{\bC G}(\rho_i \otimes V^{\otimes n}, \rho_j)$ and the vector space generated by paths from $i$ to $j$.
In particular, for a vertex $i$, the one-dimensional space $\Hom_{\bC G} (\rho_i \otimes \det{V}, \rho_i)$ gives us a path $r_i$ of length 2 from $i$ to itself up to scalars.
The set $R = \{r_i \, |\, i \in I\}$ makes $Q$ into a quiver with relations $(Q, R)$. 



\section{The construction}
Take $\Gamma \subset \SL(2,\bfk)$ a finite subgroup without quasi-reflections.
This presentation gives an action of $\Gamma$ on $\bA^2$.
Below we express a GIT problem for which the stable quotient stack is $\bX:= [\bA^2/ \Gamma]$ for one stability parameter and the minimal resolution $Y$ of the associated singularity for another.

We begin by setting up some notation.
We use $\rho_i$ to denote the irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ and $d_i$ to denote their respective ranks.
We denote the corresponding McKay quiver by $Q = (Q_0, Q_1)$ and use $A:= \bfk Q/I$ where $I$ is the corresponding ideal of preprojective relations.
We will use the symbols $i,j,k$ for vertices of $Q$; these are in correspondence with irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ by definition of the McKay quiver.
We take $P_i$ to be the projective left-modules of $A$ corresponding to $i$.
Let $T_i$ be a vector space of dimension equal to the rank of $d_i$ and $G:= \text{GL}(\oplus T_i)$.
We let $L_i:= \wedge^{d_i} T_i$ and similarly $L_V:= \wedge^2 V$.
Fix $0 \in Q_0$ to be the vertex corresponding to the trivial representation and pick an isomorphism $\bfk \simeq T_0$ once and for all.
We take $V$ to be the standard representation $\Gamma \subset \SL(2,\bfk)$ and use $I^\dagger$ for the natural isomorphism $I^\dagger \colon V^\vee \otimes L_V \rightarrow V$.

\section{The fields and constraints}
The GIT problem is given by the action of $G$ on the fields given below up to some constraints.
The fields are:
\begin{align}
    &\bfk \simeq T_0 \\
\bfx \colon &T_0 \longrightarrow V \label{fd:x} \\
\alpha_i \colon &L_i \otimes L_i \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} L_j \quad \text{for all} \,\, i\neq 0 \label{fd:alpha} \\
 P_i \colon &T_i \otimes V \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j \quad \text{for all} \,\, i\neq 0. \label{fd:P}
\end{align}
A scalar field of particular importance is $\alpha_0:= \otimes_i \,\alpha_i^{d_i}: L_V \rightarrow L_0$.
We take $P_0$ to be the unit morphism.
We write $P_i^j$ for the projection of $P_i$ to the $j$-th summand. 
Furthermore, we write $$ P_{i^\vee}: = \bigoplus_{j \rightarrow i} (P_j^i)^T \colon T_i^\vee \otimes V \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j^\vee.$$

To express the constraints we need more notation.
Note that the fields $P_i$ may naturally be rewritten as $P_i \colon T_i \rightarrow V^\vee \otimes (\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j)$.
Composing and tensoring by an appropriate line bundle allows us to state the first set of constraints.
Namely, the following diagram commutes:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{T_i \otimes L_V \ar[r]^-{P_i} \ar[d]^{\text{id}} & V^\vee \otimes L_V \otimes \big(\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j\big) \ar[r]^-{I^\dagger \otimes \text{id}} & V \otimes \big(\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j\big) \ar[r]^-{\oplus_{i \rightarrow j} P_j} & \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow k} T_k \ar[d]^{\text{id}} \\
    T_i \otimes L_V \ar[r]^-{\alpha_0} & T_i \ar[r]^-{\text{Preproj}} & \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow i} T_i \ar[r] & \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow k} T_k.
    }
\end{equation*}
Here the section $\text{Preproj}$ is defined by the preprojective relations.
%These constraints capture the semi-simplicity of representations of $\Gamma$.
% Namely, the section given by the composite 
% \begin{align}
% T_i \otimes L_V \xrightarrow{P_i} V^\vee \otimes L_V \otimes \big(\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j\big) \xrightarrow{I^\dagger \otimes \text{id}} V \otimes \big(\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j\big) \xrightarrow{\oplus_{i \rightarrow j} P_j} \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow k} T_k.
% \end{align}
% is equal to 
% \begin{align}
%  T_i \otimes L_V \xrightarrow{\otimes_i\alpha_i^{d_i}} T_i \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow i} T_i \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j \rightarrow k} T_k.
% \end{align}
% Here the second factor is defined by the preprojective relations.

The second flavour of constraints involves the scalar fields $\alpha_i$.
These constraints maybe tersely stated as follows:
\begin{align}
    \wedge^{d_i+r} P_i &= \alpha_0^r \circ \alpha_i \circ \wedge^{d_i-r} P_{i^\vee}   &\text{for} \,\, r =0,\ldots, d_i \text{ and all } i  \label{eq1:cons2} \\
    \alpha_0^r \circ \wedge^{d_i-r} P_i &= \alpha_i \circ \wedge^{d_i+r} P_{i^\vee} &\text{for} \,\, r=0,\ldots, d_i \text{ and all } i  \label{eq2:cons2} 
\end{align}
We unpack Equations~(\ref{eq1:cons2}) and (\ref{eq2:cons2}) to demonstrate that it is homogeneous with respect to the natural $G$ action on our fields: we have natural isomorphisms
$$I^\dagger_r(W) \colon \wedge^{d+r} W \rightarrow \wedge^{d-r} W^\vee \otimes L_W$$ for $W$ a $d$-dimensional vector space and $r= -d, \ldots, d$.
Precomposing $\wedge^{d_i+r} P_i$ by the inverse of isomorphism $I^{\dagger}_r(T_i \otimes V)$ and postcomposing $I^{\dagger}_r(\oplus T_j)$ gives a field that differs from $\alpha_i \circ P_{i^\vee}$ by some multiple of $L_V$.
The factor $\alpha_0^r$ is used to fix this discrepancy.

\begin{remark}
With $r=d_i-1$, the relations in (\ref{eq1:cons2}) and (\ref{eq2:cons2}) come agonizingly close to expressing $P_{i^\vee}$ in terms of $P_{i}$ or vice versa but just miss because the fields $\alpha_i$ are not invertible.
\end{remark}

It sometimes helps to group the isomorphisms $P_i$ into one big isomorphism 
$$P := \bigoplus_{i\in Q_0} P_i \colon \bigg(\bigoplus_{i\in Q_0} V_i\bigg) \otimes V_2 \rightarrow \bigoplus_{a \in Q_1} V_{h(a)}.$$
By taking $\oplus_{i\in Q_0} V_i$ to the right-hand side and dualising appropriately, the morphism $P$ naturally gives a morphism
$$\Phi := V_2 \rightarrow \bigoplus_{a \in Q_1} \Hom(V_{t(a)}, V_{h(a)}).$$
Up to the action of $\GL(\alpha)$, $\oplus_{a \in Q_1} \Hom(V_{t(a)}, V_{h(a)})$ is the moduli space of representations of $Q$ without relations.
The relations we impose on $P$ imply that $\Phi$ factors through this closed set $\cR \subset \oplus_{a \in Q_1} \Hom(V_{t(a)}, V_{h(a)})$ given by the preprojective relations.
Let $e_0$ be the idempotent of $\bfk Q$ corresponding to the vertex $0$ then we have that the ring $\bfe_0\, \bfk Q\, \bfe_0$ is the coordinate ring of the singular space $V_2\GIT\Gamma$.
We therefore have a natural morphism $\cR \longrightarrow V_2 \GIT \Gamma$.
When restricted to the open subset of $0$-generated modules of $\bfk Q$ this is a resolution of singularities.


% that the section $\wedge^{d_i} P_i$ maybe rewritten as $$\wedge^{d_i} P_i \colon \bigoplus_\lambda\, (\bS_\lambda T_i \otimes \bS_{\lambda'} V) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{\sum_{i\rightarrow j} n_j=d_i} (\wedge^{n_j}T_j)$$
% where $\lambda$ is a partition of $d_i$ with $\lambda_1 \leq 2$ and $\lambda'$ being the partition dual to $\lambda$.
% Moreover, we have natural isomorphisms \begin{equation}
%     I_\lambda \colon \bS_\lambda W \rightarrow \bS_\lambda W^\vee \otimes L_W^2 \quad\quad \text{and} \quad\quad I^\dagger_k \colon \wedge^{k} W \rightarrow \wedge^{n-k} W^\vee \otimes L_W
% \end{equation}
% where $W$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space and $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$ for which $\lambda_1 \leq 2$.
% Precomposing $\wedge^{d_i} P_i$ by the respective $I_\lambda \otimes \text{id}_V$ and postcomposing with the appropriate direct sum of the isomorphisms $I_k^\dagger$ gives a section which is comparable to  $\alpha_i \circ (\wedge^{d_i} P_{i^\vee})$.

\begin{definition}
Fields satisfying the constraints gauged by $G$ above give us a quotient stack $\cM$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The second flavour of constraints implies the first.
\end{remark}

\section{Tannakian duality and the stack $\bX$}

Formally inverting the fields $\alpha_i$ and $P_i$ in (\ref{fd:alpha})-(\ref{fd:P}) gives a quotient stack ${\cM}^\circ$ with an open embedding ${\cM}^\circ \hookrightarrow \cM$.



\begin{proposition}\label{prop:tannaka}
The stack ${\cM}^\circ$ is isomorphic to $\bX$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Given $P$, we study the associated $\Phi$.
Taking invariants, we get 
$$V_2 \xrightarrow{\Phi} \cR \rightarrow V_2\GIT\Gamma.$$
Note that this composite, up to the action of $\GL(\alpha)$, completely determines $\Phi$ since the the projection is an isomorphism between $(V_2 \GIT\Gamma) \setminus \{0\}$ and its inverse image.

It remains to consider the morphisms $V_2 \rightarrow V_2\GIT\Gamma$.
What remains of the action of $\GL(\alpha)$ is the natural $\GL(V_2)$ on the domain.
\end{proof}

% \begin{proof}
% We unfortunately do this case by case.
% The overriding idea is to start with the representation at the `special' vertex $T_0$ of the McKay quiver and reduce the $P_i$s to a normal form one by one from there.
% The first representation one meets from $T_0$ is $V$ and the next one down is a summand of $V \otimes V$ and so on, therefore in tensor categorical terms this strategy goes through understanding the fusion graph of the faithful representation $V$.

% The $A_n$ case is easy, everything in sight is rank 1 or direct sums of rank 1s.

% For $D_n$, we have that $V=T_2$.
% We pick a bases $\{e_1,e_2\}$ for $T_2$ to help with expressing what follows.
% We take the monomials of degree $n$ with respect to this basis as a basis for $S^n(T_2)$.
% Up to the fixed isomorphism $\bfk \simeq T_0$, we may take $P_0$ is taken to be the identity.
% The section $P_{0^\vee}$ naturally gives a map $P_2^0 \colon T_2 \otimes V \rightarrow T_0$, the constraint (\ref{eq1:cons2}) with $i=0$ and $r=0$ then implies that this factors through $L_V=L_2$.
% A choice of $P_{0^\vee}$ fixes a coset of $\SL(T_2)$ in $\GL(T_2)$.

% We next consider the field $P_2$, semi-simplicity implies that $P_2^1$ is orthogonal to $P_2^0$ and so factors through $S^2(T_2)$.
% The constraint (\ref{eq1:cons2}) with $i=1$ and $r=0$ gives us $P_{1^\vee}$ and hence $P_1$.
% The condition that $P_2^1$ factors through $S^2(T_2)$ then translates into into tracelessness of $P_1$.
% We may then act by $SL(T_2)$ by conjugation on $P_1$ to bring it to the form $\text{diag}(\lambda,-\lambda)$ for $\lambda \in \bfk^\times$.
% %Scaling by $T_1$ we take $\lambda$ so that $\lambda^2=-1$.
% Translating back to $P_2^1$ via the constraints, we get that $P_2^1 \colon S^2(T_2) \rightarrow T_1$ factors through the subspace generated by $e_1 e_2$.
% Semi-simplicity then implies that $P_2^3 \colon S^2(T_2) \rightarrow T_3$ is orthogonal to $P_2^1$ and so factors through the subspace $\{e_1^{\otimes 2}, e_2^{\otimes 2}\}$.
% %We may act on $S^2(T_2) \rightarrow T_3$ by $\GL(T_3)$ to fix $\mu_1=1$ and $\mu_2=1$.

% The constraint (\ref{eq1:cons2}) with $i=2$ and $r=1$ gives $P_{2^\vee}$ up to scalar.
% From this, using some natural identities, we may deduce $P_3^2$ up to a scalar multiple.
% Semi-simplicity then specifies the 2-dimensional subspace of $\Hom(T_3 \otimes T_2, T_4)$ in which the field $P_3^4 \colon T_3 \otimes T_2 \rightarrow T_4$ lives.
% A careful consideration of this subspace gives that $$T_2 \otimes S^2(T_2) \xrightarrow{\text{id} \otimes P_2^3} T_2 \otimes T_3 \xrightarrow{P_3^4} T_4$$ must factor through $S^3(T_2)$ and in particular, for our choices above, through the subspace generated by the tensors $e_1^{\otimes 3}$ and $e_2^{\otimes 3}$.
% We may act on $P_3^4$ by $\GL(T_4)$ to bring it to any form we like.

% We proceed to argue like so all the way up to the last rank two representation $T_{n-2}$ reducing all $P_i$ for $i\leq (n-3)$ to some normal form.
% This in turn, by the constraints, fixes $P_{n-2}^{n-3}$ up to scalar.
% We leave $T_{n-2}$ for now and focus on the rank 1 representations $T_{n-1}$ and $T_n$.
% We fix isomorphisms $P_{n-1}$ and $P_n$ so that the corresponding $P_{n-2}^{n-1}$ and $P_{n-2}^{n}$ are mutually orthogonal and orthogonal to $P_{n-2}^{n-3}$; this is designed to satisfy the semi-simplicity constraint.
% Again examining the subspace in which $P_{n-2}^{n-3}$ lives we may deduce that this orthogonality implies that $$T_2 \otimes S^{(n-3)}(T_2) \xrightarrow{\text{id} \otimes P_{n-3}^{n-2}} T_2 \otimes T_{n-2} \xrightarrow{P_{n-2}^{n-1}} T_{n-1}$$
% factors through the subspace of $S^{(n-2)}(T_2)$ generated by $e_1^{\otimes (n-2)}$ and $e_2^{\otimes (n-2)}$.

% Now we may act by $\SL(T_2)$ to transform $P_{n-1}$ into a form we like while preserving everything else.

% \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Take $\phi$ to be the character of $G$ with the weights $(|\Gamma|, -d_1,\ldots, -d_n)$ then $\cM^\phi \simeq \bX$
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The determinant of any semi-invariants with weight $n \phi$, for $n>0$, must contain the scalar field $\Pi_i \, \alpha_i$ as a factor.
Therefore $\Pi_i \, \alpha_i \neq 0$ for any $\phi$-stable point of $\cM$ which implies that $\alpha_i$s and $P_i$s are invertible.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
There is probably a more elegant proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:tannaka} that uses the language of rigid symmetric monoidal categories.
We apologise for not working hard enough towards it.
\end{remark}

\section{The minimal resolution}

Let $\theta$ denote the character of $G$ with weights $(-|G|,d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ and $\cM^\theta$ denote the corresponding GIT quotient.
Furthermore, let $\cN^\theta$ to denote the moduli space of quiver representations of the McKay quiver with stability parameter $\theta$.
Note that $\cN^\theta$ is isomorphic to the minimal resolution $Y$.
We construct morphisms $f \colon \cN^\theta \rightarrow \cM^\theta$ and $g \colon \cM^\theta \rightarrow \cN^\theta$ and show that they are mutual inverses.

\subsection{The morphism $f \colon \cN^\theta \rightarrow \cM$}

Take a family of quiver representations $\cN^\theta(S)$ over a test scheme $S$.
Abusing notation, this gives vector bundles $T_i$ over $S$ of the correct rank, as well as sections corresponding to the paths in the quiver.
We give the morphism $f$ by defining fields over $S$ of our GIT problem from this data.

\subsubsection{The field \bfx}

The representation $V$ either corresponds to a single vertex if irreducible or a pair of vertices if not.
The arrows from vertex $0$ to vertices corresponding to $V$ gives us a tautological section $T_0 \rightarrow V$ we take that to be the $\bfx$ of (\ref{fd:x}).

\subsubsection{The fields $\alpha_i$}

Take $0 \neq i \in Q_0$.
Since our family is $\theta$-stable and $\theta_i>0$, the universal section corresponding to arrows whose heads are $i$ is surjective. 
That is, the following is exact:
$$\bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j \longrightarrow T_i \longrightarrow 0.$$
Take $\mathfrak{K}$ to be its kernel.
The preprojective relations give us a complex
$$T_i \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j \longrightarrow T_i \longrightarrow 0$$
and hence a morphism $T_i \rightarrow \mathfrak{K}$.
We take $\alpha_i$ to be $\wedge^{d_i} T_i \rightarrow \wedge^{d_i}\mathfrak{K}.$

\subsubsection{The fields $P_i$}

The construction of $P_i$ is slightly more delicate.
The isomorphism of representations $\rho_i \otimes V \rightarrow \oplus_j\, \rho_j$ induces a morphism of internal hom-spaces $\underline{\Hom}(\rho_0, V) \rightarrow \underline{\Hom}(\rho_i, \oplus_j \, \rho_j)$.
This, in turn, gives a morphism of projective modules of our quiver and further an morphism of vector spaces $$\Hom(P_0, P_V) \rightarrow \Hom(P_i, \oplus_j \, P_j).$$
Now consider the composite $$T_i \otimes \Hom(P_0, P_V) \rightarrow T_i \otimes_\bfk \Hom(P_i, \oplus_j \, P_j) \rightarrow \bigoplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j$$ where the second factor is the evaluation map.
The stability condition $\theta$, in particular $\theta_0<0$, implies $$\text{id} \otimes \text{ev} \colon T_i \otimes_\bfk \Hom(P_0, P_V) \rightarrow T_i \otimes V$$ is surjective; checking that the kernel of $\text{id} \otimes \text{ev}$ is zero under the composite above gives us a morphism $T_i \otimes V \rightarrow \oplus_{i \rightarrow j} T_j$ that we will call $P_i$.

\subsubsection{The constraints}

The space $\cM^\theta$ is birational to $\bX$ were the constraints hold: they hold there since the corresponding statements are true for representations of $\Gamma$.

\subsection{The morphism $g \colon \cM \rightarrow \cN$}

This is by-design the easier of the two.
Given an $S$-point of $\cM$, we give the morphism $g$ by defining a family of quiver representations of $Q$ over $S$ and checking that the relations are satisfied.

As before, an $S$-point of $\cM$ naturally gives vector bundles $T_i$ over $S$ of the correct ranks.
It remains to define the sections corresponding to the arrows.
For an arrow $i \rightarrow j$ we define its corresponding section by the following composite:
$$T_i \xrightarrow{\text{id} \otimes \bfx} T_i \otimes V \xrightarrow{P_i^j} T_j.$$
The relations follow from the first set of constraints.
